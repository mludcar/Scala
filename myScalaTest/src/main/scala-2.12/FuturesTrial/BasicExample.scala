 *This is a very basic code. The main program execute 2 tasks.
 * Each tasks does nothing but wait a few seconds to simulate some execution
 * (e.g. fetching something from a database or over the network, writing to a file, â€¦).
 */
/*
Both tasks are executed sequentially on the same thread as the main program.
The first tasks takes one second to complete and the second task takes 2.
No doubt that we are wasting resources as the main thread should be able to continue execution while
the tasks are executed. Also assuming no dependencies between the tasks we should be able to run them concurrently.
